# SDL2_RenderParty

![image](https://github.com/pawbyte/SDL2_RenderParty/blob/main/images/sdl2_renderparty_logo.png?raw=true)

A simple library of extending the current functionality of SDL2 without having to change your includes. Currently supporting RenderQuads, RenderPolygons and more! It's a party a SDL2 Render Party!

Example Project of adding more sides to a rotating polygon rendered drawn with a white color:


# As of V 1.1.3 and higher, SDL2_RenderParty is now a single header library!

What this means is when including in your projects include in in your .c or .cpp files instead of your .h files for enabling implementation.

## These two lines is all you need:

```c
#define SDL2_RENDERPARTY_IMPLEMENTATION //Allows the implementation of functions to be executed, withhout this line you may experience many compiler errors! 
#include "sdl2_renderparty.h" //Includes the SDL2_RenderParty single file library ( Written in C, compatabile with C++ ) 
```

## Functions:

**bool SDL2_RenderParty_Init**();  //optional   
  
**bool SDL2_RenderParty_Quit**(); //optional   
  
//Gets the Directional Length on the X Axis , used in other calls  
**float SDL2_RenderParty_LengthdirX**( float length, float angle  );  **
  
//Gets the Directional Length on the Y Axis , used in other calls   
**float SDL2_RenderParty_LengthdirY**( float length, float angle  );**

//Renders a Circle at SDL_point(pos) with circle_radius, circle_colour, alpha(0-255) and starting and ending angle support.  
**bool SDL_RenderParty_Circle( SDL_Renderer * renderer, SDL_Texture * tex, SDL_Point pos, int circle_radius, SDL_Color * circle_colour, int alpha, float start_angle, int texture_effect );**

//Renders An Oval with an X and Y radius at SDL_point(x,y) pos  
**bool SDL_RenderParty_Oval( SDL_Renderer * renderer, SDL_Texture * tex, SDL_Point pos, int x_radius,int y_radius,SDL_Color * oval_colour, int alpha, float start_angle, int texture_effect )**


// Renders a texture or rotated rectangle based on 4 SDL_Vertices, you may toggle colors on or off and correct the inputted texture coordinates   
**bool SDL_RenderParty_Quad**( SDL_Renderer *renderer, SDL_Texture *tex, const SDL_Vertex * vertices, bool show_colors , bool update_tex_cords   );   **
  

// Renders TriangleStrips based on the inputted SDL_Vertex vertices. You will need at least 3 vertices for this function.   
// tex can be left NULL to render colored TriangleStrips. If not left blank, please see the texture_effect which is based on the sdl_partyeffect enums   
**int SDL_RenderParty_Strips**(SDL_Renderer *renderer, SDL_Texture *tex, const SDL_Vertex * vertices, int num_vertices, bool is_closed , int texture_effect   );   **
  
  
// Renders TriangleFans based on the inputted SDL_Vertex vertices. You will need at least 3 vertices for this function.   
// tex can be left NULL to render colored TriangleStrips. If not left blank, please see the texture_effect which is based on the sdl_partyeffect enums   
**int SDL_RenderParty_Fans**( SDL_Renderer *renderer, SDL_Texture *tex, const SDL_Vertex *vertices, int num_vertices, int texture_effect  );   **
  
  
// Renders a Polygon based on the inputted SDL_Vertex vertices. You will need at least 3 vertices for this function.   
// tex can be left NULL to render colored TriangleFans. If not left blank, please see the texture_effect which is based on the sdl_partyeffect enums   
**bool SDL_RenderParty_Polygon**( SDL_Renderer * renderer, SDL_Texture * tex, SDL_Point pos, int shape_length , int point_count, SDL_Color * shape_colour, int alpha, float start_angle, int texture_effect  );   **
